# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Instacart's grocery basket data to uncover key insights about customer behavior and sales patterns. The goal is to provide actionable recommendations for Instacart's marketing and sales teams to improve customer targeting and boost overall sales. The analysis is conducted using Python, leveraging libraries such as pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Objectives
The project aims to answer the following key questions for the Instacart stakeholders:

 - Busiest Days and Times: Identify the days of the week and hours of the day with the highest order volumes.
#### - Spending Patterns: Determine the times of day when customers spend the most money to inform product advertising strategies.
#### - Product Popularity: Identify which product departments have the highest frequency of orders.
#### - Customer Segmentation: Analyze customer ordering behaviors based on factors such as loyalty, region, age, and family status, to inform targeted marketing campaigns.

### Key Stakeholders

#### - Vice President of Marketing: Interested in improving ad targeting for specific customer segments.
#### - Senior Vice President of Sales: Focused on understanding the underperforming areas of Instacart's offerings.
#### - Instacart Customers: Expect personalized ads and promotions relevant to their purchasing habits.
### Data Sources
#### - Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset (2017): Available on Kaggle.

### Project Deliverables

The project is divided into several exercises, each resulting in a specific deliverable:

#### - Environment Setup: Install Anaconda, launch Jupyter notebooks, and configure the required libraries.
#### - Exploratory Data Analysis: Conduct descriptive and exploratory data analysis using pandas and other relevant libraries.
#### - Data Wrangling: Clean and preprocess the data by fixing mixed-type variables, dealing with missing values, and removing duplicates.
#### - Data Merging: Combine the provided datasets and export the merged dataset as a pickle file.
#### - Feature Engineering: Derive new columns and flags (e.g., loyalty flags) using conditional logic and grouping functions.
#### - Data Visualization: Create histograms, bar charts, line charts, and scatterplots to visualize insights.
#### - Final Report: Summarize the findings and provide recommendations to Instacart stakeholders. The report should include an analysis of customer segmentation and marketing strategies, supported by data visualization and key insights.

### Analysis Methodology

#### - Data Cleaning: Ensured data consistency by fixing mixed types, addressing missing data, and removing duplicates.
#### - Data Merging: Merged all provided datasets into a single unified dataset for analysis.
#### - Feature Engineering: Created new features to better understand customer behavior, such as loyalty flags and order frequency indicators.
#### - Visualization: Generated at least four types of visualizations to communicate insights to stakeholders effectively.

### Tools & Technologies

##### - Python: The primary programming language used for the analysis.
#### - Jupyter Notebooks: The platform used for coding, documenting, and presenting the analysis.
#### - Pandas & NumPy: Libraries for data manipulation and analysis.
#### - Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization.
#### - Anaconda: Environment manager used to install and manage the required libraries.
